the solution of quiz is to pick up one piece from the crate which is labeled Orange+apple and since "All crates label is wrong".
so if the picked up turned to be apple then crate which is labeled apple will be orange and finally the orange crate will be contains apple .

 if it turned to be orange then apple crate will be "apple + orange " and orange crate will be "apple"
this beacuse labeling done as 1 "apple" 2 "orange" 3 "apple + orange"
so after mixing the conditions will be only as follows :
1 "apple + orange" 2 "apple" 3 "orange"
or 1 "orange" 2 "apple + orange" 3 "apple"
